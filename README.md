### Tech

This app is created using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a RustðŸ¦€ framework for building a cross-platform desktop app. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a frontend layer. The compression is done entirely by [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) using platform specific standalone binaries.
The app works completely offline and no any network requests is made to/from the app.

### FAQs

1. <strong> MacOS: "CompressO" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to trash. </strong>
   !["CompressO" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to trash.](assets/image.png)
   This error is shown by Apple to gatekeep app developers from using their apps unless it's signed by Apple after paying $100/year fee. The message is completely misleading since the app is not damaged at all. Since this is a free app, I'm not going to go Apple's route just to appease them to make people trust my app. Here's a simple solution for this issue. Open your terminal and run the command:

   ```
   xattr -cr /Applications/CompressO.app
   ```

   If you don't feel comfortable applying the above solution, you can simply move the app to trash (which also means you cannot use CompressO on your Mac).

2. <strong> MacOS: "CompressO" cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified. </strong>
   !["CompressO" cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified.](assets/image-1.png)
   This error is same as the one above on FAQ 1. It's just, Apple made the message different to scare the end user. Please have a look at the solution above.
